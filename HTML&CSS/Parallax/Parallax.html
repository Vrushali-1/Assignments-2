    <h2>German Shepherd</h2>
    <p>
        German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and reach great speeds.

        There are many reasons why German Shepherds stand in the front rank of canine royalty, but experts say their defining attribute is character: loyalty, courage, confidence, the ability to learn commands for many tasks, and the willingness to put their life on the line in defense of loved ones. German Shepherds will be gentle family pets and steadfast guardians, but, the breed standard says, there’s a “certain aloofness that does not lend itself to immediate and indiscriminate friendships.”

    <h2>Siberian Husky</h2>
    <p>
        The Siberian Husky dog breed has a beautiful, thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of this breed, which originated in Siberia.

        It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian’s wolf-like looks, but beware because this athletic, intelligent dog can act independently and challenge first-time dog parents.

    <h2>Golden Retriever</h2>
    <p>
        Golden retriever males are 58-62cm tall and weigh about 29-32kg. Females are about 53-55cm tall and weigh about 25-29kg.
        The golden retriever has a water-repellent coat that is wavy or flat and gold to cream in color. One of the most attractive features of this breed is the feathering on the neck, legs, thighs, underside and tail.
        The golden retriever is even-tempered, intelligent and affectionate. Golden retrievers are playful, yet gentle with children, and they tend to get along well with other pets and strangers.
        The dog's head is strong and broad. The ears are not very large, but they sit high on the head and hang just below the jaw line. The chest is deep, and the body is well balanced. Golden retrievers live about 10 to 13 years.

    <h2>Pug</h2>
    <p>
        The pug is a breed of dog with physically distinctive features of a wrinkly, short-muzzled face, and curled tail. The breed has a fine, glossy coat that comes in a variety of colours, most often fawn or black, and a compact square body with well-developed muscles.

        Pugs were brought from China to Europe in the sixteenth century and were popularized in Western Europe by the House of Orange of the Netherlands, and the House of Stuart.[2] In the United Kingdom, in the nineteenth century, Queen Victoria developed a passion for pugs which she passed on to other members of the Royal family.

        Pugs are known for being sociable and gentle companion dogs.

    <h2>Labrador</h2>
    <p>
        The Labrador was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed. Historically, they earned their keep as fishermen’s helpers: hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish from the chilly North Atlantic.

         Today’s Lab is as good-natured and hardworking as their ancestors, and they’re also America’s most popular breed. Modern Labs work as retrievers for hunters, assistance dogs, show competitors, and search and rescue dogs, among other canine jobs.
